# Sass(SCSS)
This site uses sass (scss) for styles. 
Do not edit anything in the css folder. Instead, edit the files in the scss folder. These will need to be compiled into css/style.css using a sass compiler. There are many options, both command line and gui tools. 
To find a sass compiler, visit https://sass-lang.com/install
